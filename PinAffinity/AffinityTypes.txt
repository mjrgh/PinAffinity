# Affinity type list.  This lists the CPU affinity type classes
# that can be set within the UI.
#
# Each type is listed on a separate line, in this format:
#
#   name:affinity
#
# The name is the display name as it will appear in the UI.  The
# affinity is a 64-bit hex value for the affinity mask.  '1' bits
# represent enabled CPUs.  The least significant bit is CPU #0.
# FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF enables all CPUs; 000000000000000F enables
# only CPUs #0, 1, 2, and 3.  The program will automatically
# remove bits for non-existent CPUs, so if you want to enable all
# CPUs above a certain point, set all of the higher-order bits
# to 1.
#
# Important:  the first entry is always the default used by
# all processes that aren't set to any other type.
#
# The "factory settings" give cores 1, 2, and 3 to the Pinball
# class, and everything else to the default Normal class.  This
# arrangement scales well to different core counts, because the
# cores are always numbered from 0, and assignments to cores
# that don't exist are ignored.  So:
#
# Dual core -> VP gets core #1, everything else gets core #0
# 4 cores   -> VP gets cores #1,2,3, everything else gets #0
# 8 cores   -> VP gets cores #1,2,3, everything else gets #0,4,5,6,7
#
# VP seems to be able to make good use of three cores, since it
# has two CPU-intensive, real-time threads (the main physics/
# rendering thread, and VPinMAME), and numerous low-CPU but
# real-time threads (D3D, DirectSound, DirectInput, and DOF).
# The main VP and VPM threads are each busy enough to keep
# a core busy, but the rest of the threads combined use so
# little CPU that they won't saturate the third core.  It's
# still worthwhile to give them that third core because that
# will keep the latency low any time one of them needs to wake
# up to service an event.  But the third core won't be
# saturated, so there's probably no benefit in giving VP more
# than the three.
#
# Note that this might not be the optimal arrangement on
# hyperthreaded CPUs, so you might want to experiment with other
# settings if your system has hyperthreading.  Windows assigns
# adjacent core numbers to the virtual pairs in a hyperthreaded 
# CPU: so cores #0 and #1 are the first physical core, with its
# two virtual threads, cores #2 and #3 are the second physical
# core, and so on.  Hyperthreading lets two program threads
# share a physical core by dispatching the work that the two
# threads do to different computation units within the core.
# This can increase the overall throughput of the two threads
# taken as a whole, but it tends to slow down each individual
# thread quite a bit compared to how fast it would run if it
# had the CPU all to itself.  For game software, we're usually
# more concerned with the speed of each thread taken singly
# than with overall combined throughput.  So even though it
# seems counter-intuitive, games can actually run faster if
# you use FEWER cores in a hyperthreading system.  In
# particular, leaving core #1 idle will make the thread on
# core #0 run faster, and likewise with the other virtual
# pairs (2-3, 4-5, etc).  So for a hyperthreaded 8-core CPU,
# for example, you might want to assign things as follows:
#
#    Pinball = cores 0, 2, 4  (0000000000000015)
#    All other = cores 6+     (FFFFFFFFFFFFFFC0)   
# 
# We intentionally left cores 1, 3, and 5 with NOTHING 
# assigned to them, to minimize the activity on those cores so 
# that their virtual complement cores (0, 2, 4) can run their
# threads as fast as possible.


# DEFAULT ENTRY
# "Normal" class -> exclude CPUs 1, 2, 3, allow all others.
Normal:FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF1

# "Pinball" class -> enable CPUs 1, 2, 3
# for all non-pinball system tasks.
Pinball:000000000000000E
